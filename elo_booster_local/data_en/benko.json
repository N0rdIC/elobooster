  "idea": "The quintessential positional gambit! Black sacrifices a pawn (sometimes two with ...a6) to get lasting pressure on the open a and b files. This is not a gambit to mate, but to create long-term pressure. The fianchettoed Bg7 and Rooks on a8-b8 target the a2 and b2 pawns. Even in the endgame, the pressure continues! It's a gambit that White hates because it's hard to refute and boring to defend.",
