  "idea": "Black refuses the symmetry of 1...e5 and fights for the center with the c-pawn. After d4 cxd4 Nxd4, Black has exchanged a wing pawn (c) for a central pawn (d) - excellent deal! This creates an immediate imbalance: White has more space in the center, but Black has a queenside pawn majority and the semi-open c-file. This is the most combative opening and the most played at the highest level.",
