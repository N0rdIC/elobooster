  "idea": "The easiest system to learn! White plays the same moves regardless of Black's response: Bf4, e3, Nf3, Bd3, c3, Nbd2, 0-0. The structure is rock solid and the plan is always the same: build a pawn pyramid (d4-e3-c3) then attack on the kingside with Ne5, Qf3 or h4-h5. Ideal for beginners who want to avoid all theory and play familiar positions every game.",
