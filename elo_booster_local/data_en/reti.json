  "idea": "The most flexible opening! With 1.Nf3 and 2.g3 or 2.c4, White delays committing to a pawn structure. The Réti can transpose into the English, Catalan, King's Indian Attack, or stay independent. The fianchettoed Bg2 controls the long diagonal. White's plan: develop harmoniously, then decide on d4 or e4 based on Black's setup. Perfect for players who like to outplay opponents positionally!",
