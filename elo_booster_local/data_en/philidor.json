  "idea": "The solid response to 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3! With ...d6, Black defends e5 solidly but blocks the Bf8. The modern approach is ...Nf6, ...Be7, ...0-0, ...c6 then ...Nbd7 and ...Re8 preparing ...d5 or ...exd4 followed by ...d5. Philidor himself said 'pawns are the soul of chess' and this defense reflects that philosophy - solid structure over piece activity!",
